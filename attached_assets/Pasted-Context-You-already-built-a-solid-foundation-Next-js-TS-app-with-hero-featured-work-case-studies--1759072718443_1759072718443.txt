Context You already built a solid foundation: Next.js/TS app with hero, featured work, case studies (Problem → Approach → Impact), toolbox, about, and contact with SendGrid. Now switch into "impress hiring managers" mode. This pass upgrades visual design, interaction quality, information scent, and conversion ergonomics—without regressing on performance or a11y.

Your Role You are a senior product designer + front‑end lead + CRO strategist. Ship pixel‑level polish, tasteful motion, and friction‑free paths to "book a call"—while keeping Lighthouse/A11y targets high.

High‑Level Goals

Transform current UI into a modern, premium aesthetic (think clean editorial + product SaaS hybrid).

Make impact scannable: results and artifacts up top, narrative below.

Upgrade Contact and Case Study pages to feel "executive‑ready" and conversion‑oriented.

Maintain Perf ≥95 (mobile), A11y ≥92, Best Practices/SEO ≥95 after all changes.

Design System Upgrade (implement tokens & components)

Tokens (Tailwind + CSS vars)

Typography scale (fluid): --font-display: clamp(2.2rem, 2.6vw + 1rem, 3rem) --font-h1: clamp(1.8rem, 1.6vw + 1rem, 2.4rem) --font-h2: clamp(1.4rem, 1.2vw + 0.9rem, 1.8rem) --font-body: clamp(1rem, 0.35vw + 0.9rem, 1.1rem)

Radius: --r-card: 1.25rem; --r-chip: 999px

Shadows: --sh-card: 0 8px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.06); --sh-hover: 0 12px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.10)

Spacing: --space-section: clamp(2.5rem, 6vw, 5rem)

Color (light/dark): background, surface, muted, border, primary (accent), success, warning; provide HSL vars for easy theming

Motion: --dur-fast: 160ms; --dur-med: 260ms; --easing: cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.2,1)

Typography

Headings: switch to a modern grotesk (e.g., Inter/Space Grotesk) or keep current serif for display but pair with humanist sans for body. Tighten letter‑spacing for H1/H2 and increase line‑height on longform.

Components (new or upgraded)

AppHeader: sticky, reduced height on scroll, active link indicator, subtle bottom border blur.

StatChips: compact KPI chips with icon + label + value (e.g., +112% Attribution Accuracy). Provide aria‑labels with baseline/value.

StatBar: horizontal highlight panel under the hero on work detail, summarizing 3–4 key outcomes.

Card v2: soft shadow, 1px border, hover lift + translate‑y‑1, focus-visible ring.

FilterChips: segmented toggle group with overflow scroll on mobile; maintains URL query state.

EvidenceGallery: responsive grid + lightbox with keyboard navigation; supports images, GIFs, MP4.

BeforeAfterSlider: accessible slider with touch/keyboard support for visual diffs.

TOC Sticky: on case studies, a sticky sidebar that highlights reading progress.

TestimonialSlider: snap carousel with manual controls; auto‑advance only when user opts in.

LogoWall: grayscale logos with hover to full color.

ContactCTA: sticky mobile footer with "Book a 15‑min walk‑through".

EmptyState + LoadingSkeletons for work grid and case study.

Page‑Level Upgrades A) Home

New hero layout with headline on left, KPI trio and credibility logos on right.

Add mini case study rail (3 cards) with “Read in 2 min” badges.

Insert LogoWall of notable clients/sectors (can be generic if redacted).

Add microcopy under primary CTA: “Response within 24h • No sales fluff.”

B) Work (Index)

Add filter chips (role: Eng, Product, Growth; focus: Performance, Attribution, Security…).

Cards use Card v2 with 1–2 KPIs surfaced. Include reading time + stack badges.

Add search (client‑side) with fuzzy match over title/summary/tags.

C) Work (Detail)

Above title, surface breadcrumb + reading time.

Under hero, add StatBar with 3–4 outcomes. Float a “View artifacts” anchor.

Introduce TOC Sticky for long reads.

EvidenceGallery section with captions citing the outcome it supports.

Add BeforeAfterSlider when filename pattern includes before/after.

Add “Playbook” block (bulleted techniques) + “What I’d do next” to show senior thinking.

Related work rail at bottom (same tags).

D) Toolbox

Convert long cards into compact "Challenge → Action → Result" tiles with iconography.

Add copy scanlines: 1‑sentence outcome at the end of each tile.

E) Contact

Two‑column: form on left, calendar embed on right (Calendly or Cal.com).

Keep options grid (Email, Video Call, Phone) but compress copy; add trust badges (response SLAs).

Add hidden UTM source, medium, campaign; persist in localStorage.

Success page shows 2 recommended case studies + ICS calendar attach.

F) About

Add “Principles & Working Style” list + "How we ship" mini timeline (Kickoff → Metrics → Launch → Iterate).

Interaction & Motion (Framer Motion)

Hover: cards lift 2–4px with subtle shadow and scale 1.01 (prefers‑reduced‑motion respected).

Entrance: section fade/translate‑y‑8 on viewport with stagger.

Active filter chips animate underline.

Accessibility & Semantics

Ensure heading order logical; all interactive elements have focus states.

Keyboard access: header menu, carousels, lightbox, before/after slider.

Descriptive alt on all images; decorative images alt="".

Engineering Tasks (concrete)

Tailwind/theme: add tokens and update tailwind.config.ts and global CSS.

Replace current cards with Card v2 and StatChips components.

Implement FilterChips with URL sync; add fuzzy search (client‑side) on Work index.

Build EvidenceGallery + BeforeAfterSlider and wire to case study frontmatter artifacts.

Add TOC sticky using @/components/toc driven by MDX headings.

Add ContactCTA sticky on mobile; implement dismiss logic via localStorage.

Add calendar embed (Calendly/Cal.com) on Contact; ensure noopener/noreferrer and lazy load.

Analytics: track filter_select, search_query, toc_click, gallery_open, cta_book_call.

Performance: code‑split gallery/slider; use dynamic import; prefetch on hover; ensure image sizes correct.

SEO: per‑page OG image generator (title + 1–2 KPIs); ensure JSON‑LD for Person/Article/Breadcrumb.

Copy Polish (generate variants)

Hero headline: generate 3 options; subhead 3 options; CTA labels 3 options (book call, view work, download resume).

Case study leads: rewrite first paragraph to foreground outcome in first sentence.

Microcopy for contact trust (e.g., “Replies in 24h. Zero spam.”).

Data & Content Model Adjustments

Extend case study frontmatter with: readingTime, kpis[], tags[], confidential, evidence[], beforeAfter[].

Add clientSectors[] for logo wall grouping; support redacted labels.
