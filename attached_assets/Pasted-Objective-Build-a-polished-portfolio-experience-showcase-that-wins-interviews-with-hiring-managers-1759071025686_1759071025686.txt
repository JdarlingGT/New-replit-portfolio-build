Objective Build a polished portfolio + experience showcase that wins interviews with hiring managers and teams. Prioritize clarity, credibility, and conversion over novelty. Ship production-grade code and conversion-ready content with a dead-simple editing workflow (no code required for routine updates).

Role You are an expert full‑stack dev + brand-focused marketer. Operate like a senior product designer, copywriter, and growth engineer in one. Your output must include code, structured content, and a README that a busy candidate can maintain in minutes.

Primary Audience

Hiring managers, team leads, and recruiters at modern software companies.

Secondary Audience

IC engineers/designers who influence hiring decisions.

Success Criteria (you are accountable for these)

Above-the-fold clarity: communicates role, focus, and value in <5 seconds.

Proof of impact visible in <30 seconds (metrics, shipped work, artifacts).

Drives qualified contact: intro call or warm reply within 24–72 hours post-visit.

Quality bars: Lighthouse Performance/Best Practices/SEO ≥95; Accessibility ≥90.

Tech Stack (preferred; use judgment if a better choice improves DX/maintainability)

Framework: Next.js (App Router) or Astro with TypeScript. Use Vite/Turbopack where applicable.

Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theming; light/dark mode with prefers-color-scheme.

Content: MDX + Contentlayer (or simple JSON/YAML). No headless-CMS lock‑in required to launch.

Images: Next/Image (or Astro Image) with responsive srcset, AVIF/WebP, blur-up placeholders.

Forms: Serverless route (e.g., /api/contact) with honeypot + rate limit. Email via chosen provider with a clean adapter.

Analytics: Privacy-safe (Plausible or Umami) + event hooks for CTA clicks, case-study expands, resume downloads.

Testing: Smoke tests for critical routes; CI a11y check with axe (fast ruleset).

Information Architecture

Home: Hero, proof (logos/metrics), featured work, testimonials, primary CTA.

Work/Case Studies: Filterable grid; each study has Problem → Approach → Impact, artifacts, stack, learnings.

Experience: Timeline with roles, responsibilities, stack, impact bullets.

Skills: Grouped by Frontend/Backend/Design/Marketing/Growth with proficiency levels + evidence links.

About: Story, principles, working style, certs.

Testimonials: Pull quotes + logos; surface 2–4 on Home.

Contact: Form + "book a call" link; social links; resume download.

(Optional) Blog/Notes: MDX posts; RSS; /sitemap.xml.

Conversion Strategy (bake into build)

Primary CTA: "Request portfolio walk‑through" (booking link or form modal).

Secondary CTA: "View case studies" (anchor scroll to Work grid).

Sticky mobile footer CTA; exit-intent soft prompt on desktop.

UTM capture in a hidden field on contact form; store in localStorage for prefill.

Copy Requirements (write initial drafts)

Tone: confident, specific, outcome-first. No buzzword salad.

Hero headline options (generate 3):

"I build fast, usable products that ship—and get used."

"Full‑stack execution with growth instincts and receipts."

"From prototype to production: speed, polish, and measurable impact."

Subhead: one sentence clarifying role + outcomes (generate 2–3 variants).

Case-study intros: 1–2 sentences each; show problem, constraints, and target user.

Impact chips: surface 2–4 metrics at the top of each study (e.g., "+38% sign‑ups", "LCP 4.3s → 1.8s").

Components & UX

Sticky header with progress bar on scroll.

Card system for case-study teasers; chip filters by role/skill.

Accessible image gallery/lightbox; keyboard + reduced-motion friendly.

Testimonials slider with pause/play; avoid auto-scroll for a11y unless user opts in.

Breadcrumbs on case studies; back-to-grid link persists viewport state.

Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

Visible focus rings; skip-to-content link; semantic landmarks.

Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1; prefers-reduced-motion honored.

Keyboard-accessible modals, menus, and lightbox (no traps).

All images have alt; decorative images use empty alt.

Performance Budget

LCP < 2.5s on 4G; CLS < 0.1; TBT < 200ms.

Code-split routes; tree-shake icons; lazy-load offscreen media; prefetch on hover.

Serve AVIF/WebP; responsive sizes; blur-up placeholders; no layout shifts.

SEO & Structured Data

Semantic headings; descriptive titles/meta; canonical URLs.

JSON‑LD: Person (site owner), Article/CreativeWork (case studies), BreadcrumbList.

OpenGraph/Twitter cards; /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt.

Content Model (files you generate)

/content/work/[slug].mdx with frontmatter: title, role, timeframe, context, problem, constraints[], stack[], results[{metric, baseline, value, delta, unit, period}], artifacts[{src,type,caption,alt}], learnings[], confidential

/content/experience.json: roles with start/end, highlights, stack, impact metrics.

/content/skills.json: grouped categories, levels (1–5), evidence links.

Forms & Follow‑Up

/api/contact validates, rate-limits, emails, and logs to a flat file/SQLite.

Hidden source/utm fields; optional webhook for future CRM.

Thank-you page with a calendar link + 2 curated case studies.

Analytics Events (implement data layer)

cta_click {location, label}

case_open {slug}

resume_download

contact_submit {valid, source}

Testing & CI

Route smoke tests (200 status + key text markers).

Axe a11y check in CI (fast ruleset); fail build under thresholds.

Basic unit tests for utilities (date/metric formatters).

Deliverables

Running app with pages above; responsive and themed (light/dark).

Populated with 2–3 sample case studies and 6–9 work cards (use placeholders if assets absent).

README: how to add a case study, update skills/experience, change theme, deploy.

Performance and a11y reports/screenshots.

Acceptance Checklist (must pass before completion)




Implementation Notes

Favor server components for content pages; keep client components minimal.

Provide a small utility to format metrics (1,200 → 1.2k; 0.83 → 83pp for percentage-point moves).

Keep styles tokenized (CSS variables) for easy theme swaps.

What to Hand Back

Repo URL + deployment link

README with edit instructions

Short list of data you still need from me (bulleted)

Kickoff Tasks (do these now)

Scaffold project and Tailwind/theme tokens.

Implement Home, Work, Work detail, Experience, Skills, About, Contact.

Wire MDX/Contentlayer + /content directory; add sample content.

Implement contact API with validation, email, logging, UTM capture.

Add analytics events; verify firing on key interactions.

Optimize performance/a11y; run Lighthouse + axe in CI.

Deliver README + checklist and deploy.

Voice & Vibes

Confident, concrete, outcomes-first. A little cheeky is fine; buzzword soup is not. Focus on receipts.
